  Dynamic app registration is available starting from Teleport `8.0`.
</Details>

Dynamic app registration allows Teleport administrators to register new apps
(or update/unregister existing ones) without having to update the static
configuration and restarting the app agents.

To enable dynamic registration, include a `resources` section in your app
agent configuration with a list of resource label selectors you'd like this
agent to monitor:

```yaml
app_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

You can use a wildcard selector to monitor all app resources in the cluster,
or provide a specific set of labels to monitor a subset:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
```

Next define an application resource:

```yaml
kind: app
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
  description: "Example app"
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  uri: http://localhost:4321
  public_addr: test.example.com
```

See the full app resource spec [reference](../reference.mdx#application-resource).

The user creating the dynamic registration needs to have a role with access to the 
application labels and the `app` resource.  In this example role the user can only
create and maintain application services labeled `env: test`.
```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: dynamicappregexample
spec:
  allow:
    app_labels:      
      env: test
    rules:
    - resources:
      - app
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v5
```

To create an application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create app.yaml
```

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
apps (in `tsh app ls` or UI) as long as at least one application agent picks it
up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f app.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular app agent, it
will unregister and stop proxying it.

To delete an application resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm app/example
```
