  Dynamic database registration is available starting from Teleport `8.0`.
</Details>

Dynamic database registration allows Teleport administrators to register new
databases (or update/unregister existing ones) without having to update the
static configuration and restarting the database agents.

To enable dynamic registration, include a `resources` section in your database
agent configuration with a list of resource label selectors you'd like this
agent to monitor:

```yaml
db_service:
  enabled: "yes"
  resources:
  - labels:
      "*": "*"
```

You can use a wildcard selector to monitor all database resources in the cluster,
or provide a specific set of labels to monitor a subset:

```yaml
resources:
- labels:
    "env": "prod"
    "engine": "postgres"
- labels:
    "env": "test"
    "engine": "mysql"
```

Next define a database resource:

```yaml
kind: db
version: v3
metadata:
  name: example
  description: "Example database"
  labels:
    env: prod
    engine: postgres
spec:
  protocol: "postgres"
  uri: "localhost:5432"
```


The user creating the dynamic registration needs to have a role with access to the 
database labels and the `db` resource.  In this example role the user can only
create and maintain database services labeled `env: prod` and `engine: postgres`.
```yaml
kind: role
metadata:
  name: dynamicregexample
spec:
  allow:
    db_labels:
      engine: postgres
      env: prod
    rules:
    - resources:
      - db
      verbs:
      - list
      - create
      - read
      - update
      - delete
version: v5
```

See the full database resource spec [reference](../reference/configuration.mdx#database-resource).

To create a database resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create database.yaml
```

(!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

After the resource has been created, it will appear among the list of available
databases (in `tsh db ls` or UI) as long as at least one database agent picks
it up according to its label selectors.

To update an existing database resource, run:

```code
$ tctl create -f database.yaml
```

If the updated resource's labels no longer match a particular database agent, it
will unregister and stop proxying it.

To delete a database resource, run:

```code
$ tctl rm db/example
```
